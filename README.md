# Document for Web

## 1. Quick Start

### 1.1 Start Online

Access [http://etcd.beifengtz.com](http://etcd.beifengtz.com)

* account：test
* password：test

> **Note** This test client is for display only. Please do not save real connection information in it. The saved information will be public to all people who log in to the test account.
> Demo will not retain or record all connection information, but to avoid leaking your connection information, please use the test ETCD address or use a private deployment experience.

### Start on Locally

First, make sure your local environment has JDK 11 or above, download the latest jar package from [release](https://github.com/tzfun/etcd-workbench/releases) and execute:

```shell
java -jar etcd-workbench.jar
```

Access `http://localhost:8002` in browser.

## 2. Private Deployment

### 2.1 Configuration

The configuration of web deployment is very simple, only one configuration file is required, and the configuration content is very small. For the complete configuration file, please see [etcd-workbench.conf](server/src/main/resources/etcd-workbench.conf).

### 2.2 Run in Local

First, make sure that your local environment has the **JDK 11+** version, download the latest jar package from [release](https://github.com/tzfun/etcd-workbench/releases), and place the configuration file `etcd-workbench.conf` in the same directory as the jar package to take effect. Execute startup:

```shell
java -jar etcd-workbench.jar
```

Access `http://localhost:8002` in browser.

### 2.3 Run in Docker

Docker hub repository address: [https://hub.docker.com/r/tzfun/etcd-workbench](https://hub.docker.com/r/tzfun/etcd-workbench)

Pull the Docker image:

```shell
docker pull tzfun/etcd-workbench
```

Start container:

```shell
docker run \
    --name my-etcd-workbench \
    -p 8002:8002 \
    -v ./etcd-workbench.conf:/usr/tzfun/etcd-workbench/etcd-workbench.conf \
    -d \
    tzfun/etcd-workbench:latest
```

The working directory of the image is in `/usr/tzfun/etcd-workbench`, and its directory structure is as follows:

```
/usr/tzfun/etcd-workbench # tree
├── bin
├── data
├── logs
├── temp
├── etcd-workbench.conf
└── etcd-workbench.jar
```
